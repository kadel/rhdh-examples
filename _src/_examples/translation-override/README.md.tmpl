# Translation Override Example

This example demonstrates how to customize UI labels and text in Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH) using the i18n translation override feature. This allows you to rename filter labels, buttons, and other UI elements without modifying the source code.

## What's Included

- **Custom Translation File**: JSON file with translation overrides for catalog picker labels
- **ConfigMap Mount**: Mounts the translation file into the RHDH container
- **i18n Configuration**: Configures RHDH to load the custom translations

## How It Works

RHDH supports i18n (internationalization) with the ability to override default translations. By providing a JSON file with custom translations and mounting it into the container, you can customize any translatable text in the UI.

### Translation File Format

The translation file uses a nested structure: `plugin-id` -> `locale` -> `translation-key`:

```json
{{include:config/allTranslations.json}}
```

In this example, the catalog filter labels are renamed:
- "Kind" becomes "MyKind"
- "Type" becomes "MyType"
- "Owner" becomes "MyOwner"
- etc.

### App Configuration

The `app-config.yaml` configures RHDH to load the translation overrides:

```yaml
{{include:config/app-config.yaml}}
```

The `i18n.overrides` array points to the mounted translation file location inside the container.

## Configuration Details

### ConfigMap for Translations

The translation file is packaged as a ConfigMap:

```yaml
{{include:config/kustomization.yaml}}
```

### Helm Configuration

For Helm deployments, the ConfigMap is mounted as an extra volume:

```yaml
{{include:helm/patches/values.yaml}}
```

### Operator Configuration

For Operator deployments, the ConfigMap is mounted via `extraFiles`:

```yaml
{{include:operator/patches/rhdh.yaml}}
```

## Finding Translation Keys

To find available translation keys for a plugin:

1. Check the plugin's source code for `useTranslationRef` usage
2. Look for `*Translation.ts` files in the plugin package
3. Common plugins with translations:
   - `catalog-react`: Catalog UI components
   - `scaffolder`: Software Templates UI
   - `techdocs`: TechDocs UI

## Installation

Choose either Helm or Operator-based deployment:

### Using Helm

```bash
cd helm
./install.sh
```

### Using the RHDH Operator

```bash
cd operator
./install.sh
```

## Uninstallation

### Using Helm

```bash
cd helm
./uninstall.sh
```

### Using the RHDH Operator

```bash
cd operator
./uninstall.sh
```
